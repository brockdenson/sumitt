# 📬 About Sumitt

**Sumitt** is an intelligent assistant that summarizes group chat activity for friends who want to stay connected without being constantly online. Built originally to help our friend Colton stay in the loop after deleting Snapchat, Sumitt has evolved into a personal digital bridge—one that respects attention, values connection, and uses AI to make modern relationships feel more human.

## ✨ What It Does

- Captures Snapchat group chat content via automated screenshots
- Extracts chat text using Tesseract OCR
- Uses GPT-4 to summarize the week’s events in a casual, witty tone
- Sends summaries to users via SMS or Discord
- Stores all summaries locally for future “rewind” or reference
- Optional interactivity so users can reply or ask questions through a bot

## 🎯 Mission Statement

**Mission Statement**

To empower people to disconnect from distracting platforms without disconnecting from their friends, by delivering thoughtful, personalized, and automated recaps that preserve connection, context, and community—without pressure or noise.

## 🧠 Philosophy

> **“Connection without distraction.”**

Every line of code and feature in Sumitt follows this principle:
- Does it help users stay connected to people they care about?
- Does it reduce the need to scroll, swipe, or waste time?
- Does it respect privacy and the emotional nature of group chats?

## 🧱 How It Works

1. **Capture** — A second Snapchat account takes automated screenshots each day
2. **Extract** — OCR pulls out chat messages from the images
3. **Summarize** — GPT-4 converts raw logs into digestible, categorized updates
4. **Deliver** — Twilio (or Discord) sends the summary to a recipient like Colton
5. **Interact (optional)** — The user can reply, ask for more info, or send a message back to the group

## 💡 Designed for Real Humans

Sumitt uses smart formatting, memory of past chats, and inside jokes to bring warmth and personality to summaries. The voice of the bot will feel consistent and familiar, like a friend giving you the scoop. The entire experience is shaped to be casual, emotional, and easy—like a personal assistant made for your friend group.

## 🔐 Privacy First

- No cloud databases or public APIs used to store your chats
- All data is local unless explicitly shared through a message
- Your screenshots and summaries are yours, always

---

## 🔮 Future Vision

- Scheduled weekly digests (e.g., Sunday evening)
- Discord bot for question answering and 2-way chat
- Yearly group rewind reports with best moments
- Support for other platforms (Messenger, Instagram DMs, etc.)
